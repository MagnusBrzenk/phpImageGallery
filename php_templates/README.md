# Template Files

This is where files go that will be copied/linked into galleries once they're created.

The main file is `phpImageGallery.php`. Every gallery that get's created will have this file soft-linked into an index.php file in the gallery dir, which displays the media from in that dir. (By using links, it helps to develop the code.)
