-   Modify `_create_dirs.sh` to `_create_gallery.sh`. This script will take a gallery name as argument and will create a dir of that argument as the name of the newly created argument. That dir will receive a copy of the main php script -- to be named `index.php`, which will display the gallery. The "gallery" (= the dir of that gallery's name) will also have media directories (`triage`, `images`, `videos`, `image-thumbs` and `video-thumbs`) as we already have. A copy shall also be made of a `.env-template` file to be used by the `_rsync_script.sh`. The equivalent of `_sort_triage.sh` will then also need to take a gallery name as argument. Also, let's add a default `.htaccess` and `.htpasswd` to these galleries for now.

Finally, the root directory for the repo will no longer be for a single gallery, as is presently the case, but will be some sort of menu view showing all existing galleries. Later, we can think about adding different authentication options for the different galleries.
